What is database?
    - Database is a collection of organized data.
        - Data is arranged and organized in a meaningful way

    Random Group of data without meaning:
    "Michael Smith",
    "Cancelled",
    true,
    25000,
    Corn Flakes,
    5

Data vs Information

Data
    - is a raw input and does not hold specific meaning
Information
    - is a data arranged and hold a specific meaning. It is usually associated with a data and a label.

    DBMS
        - Database Management System
        - A database management system allows us to manipulate/manage databases. We could perform operations on our database.

        What is CRUD?
            - basic operation to manipulate and manage a database

                - C - create
                    - to add/insert an entry into the database
                - R - read/retrieve
                    - to select and update an entry from a database
                - U - update
                    - to select and update an entry from database
                - D - delete
                    - to select and delete an entry from database
        Relational Databases
            - allows us to store data and information and arrange them meaningfully in a table

                - Data is arranged and stored in a Table with rows and columns

        Relational Database for an E-commerce website

        Product Tables
        id      name    price
        1       PS5     27500
        2       PS4     16000

        Structured Query Language (SQL)
            - it is typically used to programmatically manage or manipulate of a relational database.

        NoSQL
            - Not Only Structure Query Language
                - Data is arranged and organized in JSON Format
                - Data is arranged and organized in a more complex and scalable format.
        
        [
            {
                "id": 123-0123,
                "name": "PS5",
                "price": 27500
            },
            {
                "id": 123-0124,
                "name": "PS4",
                "price": 16000
            }
        ]

                                        SQL          No SQL
    A collection/group of data:         Table        Document
    An entry level of data:             Tow          Document
    Defines the value of an entry:      columns      Fields


SQL and NoSQL - Use Case
    - SQL/relational database
        - data and its structure changes less and need not to be changed immediately and dynamically.

        - most banks/financial institutions uses RDBMS.
    - NoSQL
        - data and structure often and its dynamics

MERN - The letter "M" is a MERN Stack
    MongoDB

    The reason why MongoDB is called Mongo "humongous"
        - it refers to the way that in MongoDB, data structure can become huge

        - MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database

        Ex. Mongo Atlas
